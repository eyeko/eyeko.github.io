		<li>Bountiful, UT</li>

	<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<br>"Passing cars,
		<br>When you can't see,
		<br>May get you,
		<br>A glimpse,
		<br>Of eternity."

	<p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.</p>  
<p>Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>cellphone</li>
		<li>iPod</li>
		<li>digital camera</li>
		<li>protein bar</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said,</p>
	<q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
